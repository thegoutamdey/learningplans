### Practice and Project Ideas:
- **Practice**: Redesign a small app or open-source project from GitHub, applying low-level design principles like SOLID and design patterns.
- **Code Reviews**: Engage in peer reviews or participate in online communities like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [Code Review Stack Exchange](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/).

By following this plan and utilizing the provided YouTube resources, you can gain a strong foundation in low-level software design in 5 weeks. Be sure to practice frequently and experiment with small projects for hands-on experience.
